# About me
Hello! My name is Wasi Mohamed. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania and my family comes from Chennai (Madras) in Southern India. I came to Pittsburgh in 2011 to attend the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with degrees in Neuroscience, Philosophy, and the History and Philosophy of Science. I am currently the Senior Policy Officer at The Pittsburgh Foundation and am a student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. 

## What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to create compelling and clear data visualizations. I also hope to learn how to interpret data visualizations and be able to quickly spot misleading and poorly contructed ones.
