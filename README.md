Wasi's portfolio page: Created for the Telling Stories with Data Course - Summer 2020

# About me
Hello! My name is Wasi Mohamed. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania and my family comes from Chennai (Madras) in Southern India. I came to Pittsburgh in 2011 to attend the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with degrees in Neuroscience, Philosophy, and the History and Philosophy of Science. I am currently the Senior Policy Officer at The Pittsburgh Foundation and am a student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. 

## What I hope to learn from this course
I hope to learn how to create compelling and clear data visualizations. I also hope to learn how to interpret data visualizations and be able to quickly spot misleading and poorly contructed ones.

## LINKS TO ASSIGNMENTS

## Link to Data Visualization #1, Assignment 2: 
[Visualizing Government Debt](https://wasimohamed2020.github.io/cmustudent-repository/dataviz2)

Description:
This page contains comparisons of Debt-to-GDP ratios of governments in 2015. These governments are all members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It contains three data visualizations: a bar chart, a grid of line chart, and a treemap. The data comes from data.oecd.org.



## Link to Data Visualization #2, Assignment 3 & 4: 
[Critique by Design - Allegheny County Jail Population Trends](https://wasimohamed2020.github.io/cmustudent-repository/dataviz3)

Description: 
This page contains a critique and redesign of a data visualization used by Allegheny County to demonstrate changes in the Allegheny County Jail Population over a period of time where several interventions were implemented in order to decrease the population by 20%. Since 2017, Allegheny County has participated in the Safety and Justice Challenge as an Innovation site, one of 20 competitively selected jurisdictions receiving small project grants and technical assistance from the Urban Institute in support of targeted efforts to safely reduce jail misuse and overuse. The MacArthur Foundation gave the county $2 Million to make this happen. The data came from the [Allegheny County Data Warehouse](https://www.alleghenycountyanalytics.us/index.php/2019/11/04/allegheny-county-jail-population-management-dashboards-2/) 



## Link to Final Project: 
[Policing and Public Safety in Pittsburgh: Did the addition of the police substation in Northview Heights impact crime rates?](https://wasimohamed2020.github.io/cmustudent-repository/final_project_WasiMohamed)

Description:
This page contains my final project, a look into policing and public safety in Pittsburgh. This looks at the case study of Northview Heights and if the addition of a Pittsburgh Bureau of Police substation in the neighborhood had an effect on crime. It follows a story that starts with a community survey and ends with data that is part of an assessment of the effectiveness of an intervention. I used Shorthand to create this project and the link is found on this page. The data came from the [Allegheny County Data Warehouse](https://tableau.alleghenycounty.us/t/PublicSite/views/CJ_UCR_PGH_8-22-17_v3/Home?:embed=y&:showAppBanner=false&:showShareOptions=true&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no).
