# About me
Hello! My name is Wasi Mohamed. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania and my family comes from Chennai (Madras) in Southern India. I came to Pittsburgh in 2011 to attend the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with degrees in Neuroscience, Philosophy, and the History and Philosophy of Science. I am currently the Senior Policy Officer at The Pittsburgh Foundation and am a student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. 

## What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to create compelling and clear data visualizations. I also hope to learn how to interpret data visualizations and be able to quickly spot misleading and poorly contructed ones.

# 2015 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Bar Chart
<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/61R0" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/61R0" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2015</a></iframe>
## DESCRIPTION
This chart compares the Debt-to-GDP ratios of governments in 2015. The governments that have the highest ratio are on the right whereas the governments with the lowest ratio are on the left. General government Debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. If one hovers over any bar, they will be able to see the % of GDP. This kind of visualization is particularly effective in allowing one to quickly discern which countries have the highest and lowest ratios in 2015. 




# 1995-2015 Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Grid of Line Chart
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3191094" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3191094/embed"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
## DESCRIPTION
This visualization shows a series of graphs that each plot a government's Debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2015. If one hovers over the line at each point, one can see the Debt-to-GDP ratio for each year. This allows one to compare trends in the Debt-to-GDP ratios for each country over time. It also allows one to compare trends and absolute ratio values between countries. The previous bar chart does not allow one to understand government trends over years and it also does not allow one to compare one countries trend with anothers. This visualization is more useful in making clear trends and year-to-year changes in Debt-to-GDP ratio. 




# Year-by-Year Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Treemap

## DESCRIPTION
This visualization allows one to view the relative values of the Debt-to-GDP ratios of governments in a selected year between 1995 and 2019. If one hovers over a square, one can see the year, Debt-to-GDP ratio, and full government name. After selecting a year, one can compare Debt-to-GDP ratios between countries with the countries with the largest ratios being represented by the largest squares. The countries with smallet Debt-to-GDP ratios will have the smallest squares. This visualization is similar to the first one in that it allows one to see which governments have the highest ratio easily. However, this visualization allows one to understand how the relative value of ratios changes from year-to-year because of the drop down menu. This is different from the second graph because it is much easier to see relative size year-to-year but it is much more difficult to compare trends.
