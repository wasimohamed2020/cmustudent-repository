## Rationale for Selection

I selected this particular data visualization because it has to do with one of the most contentious political issues in the county: Allegheny Couny Jail. Numerous lawsuits and years of scrutinity have forced hundreds of staffers and advocates to think deeply and work to design solutions to the many issues that plague this part of our public safety infrastructe. Since 2017, Allegheny County has participated in the Safety and Justice Challenge as an Innovation site, one of 20 competitively selected jurisdictions receiving small project grants and technical assistance from the Urban Institute in support of targeted efforts to safely reduce jail misuse and overuse. The MacArthur Foundation gave the county $2 Million. This visualization shows the progress of the county on reducing the population of the jail during the period of the pilot. When I saw this visualization, it was immediately clear to me that it was insufficient

## Wireframes and What I Learned

This visualization was sent to me as part of a preliminary report that is not yet public (although the data is publicly available). The purpose of this visualization was to show the impact of interventions on the jail population from 2019 to 2021. Allegheny County received funding to decrease the population by 20% in 2 years. This visualization is fairly useful because it does give one an understanding of the changes in jail population over the 31 months depicted. Although relevant data is included, I believe crucial data is missing. The date of key interventions has been left out and there is no mention of the impact of COVID-19. Also, I believe more data is needed to understand the trends pre-interventions. The information is easy to understand but can lead to misleading conclusions without the additional information so this is not particularly truthful. It is intuitive in a sense; one is quick to see what is being depicted. What is not clear is the impact of particular interventions and events. It encourages the audience to learn more only because of the precipitous drop in the past few months and the aesthetic is acceptable but at all exceptional. 

The first wireframe I created simply added markers of when interventions were introduced and when COVID-19 began to impact the jail population. I removed the additional demographics charts and most of the extraneous text as well:

I then realized that seeing 5 years of data was much better than seeing 3 years of data in terms of allowing the viewer to understand trends. This new view makes it clear that although a precipitous decline is seen, the overall trend in jail population was not significantly impacted until the effects of COVID-19 were seen. This paints a completely different story and calls into questions the effectiveness of the interventions being introduced. With over $2 Million having been invested so far, this calls for serious investigation.
