## Rationale
I selected this particular data visualization because it has to do with one of the most contentious political issues in the county: Allegheny Couny Jail. Numerous lawsuits and years of scrutinity have forced hundreds of staffers and advocates to think deeply and work to design solutions to the many issues that plague this part of our public safety infrastructe. Since 2017, Allegheny County has participated in the Safety and Justice Challenge as an Innovation site, one of 20 competitively selected jurisdictions receiving small project grants and technical assistance from the Urban Institute in support of targeted efforts to safely reduce jail misuse and overuse. The MacArthur Foundation gave the county $2 Million. This visualization shows the progress of the county on reducing the population of the jail during the period of the pilot.
