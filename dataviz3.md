## Rationale for Selection

I selected this particular data visualization because it has to do with one of the most contentious political issues in the county: Allegheny Couny Jail. Numerous lawsuits and years of scrutiny have forced hundreds of staffers and advocates to think deeply and work to design solutions to the many issues that plague this part of our public safety infrastructure. Since 2017, Allegheny County has participated in the Safety and Justice Challenge as an Innovation site, one of 20 competitively selected jurisdictions receiving small project grants and technical assistance from the Urban Institute in support of targeted efforts to safely reduce jail misuse and overuse. The MacArthur Foundation gave the county $2 Million. This visualization shows the progress of the county on reducing the population of the jail during the period of the pilot. When I saw this visualization, it was immediately clear to me that it was insufficient. The audience for this visualization is a combination of advocates and funders who want to see reform. 

## Wireframes and What I Learned

This visualization was sent to me as part of a preliminary report that is not yet public (although the data is publicly available). The purpose of this visualization was to show the impact of interventions on the jail population from 2019 to 2021. Allegheny County received funding to decrease the population by 20% in 2 years. This visualization is fairly useful because it does give one an understanding of the changes in jail population over the 31 months depicted. Although relevant data is included, I believe crucial data is missing. The date of key interventions has been left out and there is no mention of the impact of COVID-19. Also, I believe more data is needed to understand the trends pre-interventions. The information is easy to understand but can lead to misleading conclusions without the additional information so this is not particularly truthful. It is intuitive in a sense; one is quick to see what is being depicted. What is not clear is the impact of particular interventions and events. It encourages the audience to learn more only because of the precipitous drop in the past few months and the aesthetic is acceptable but at all exceptional. 

The first wireframe I created simply added markers of when interventions were introduced and when COVID-19 began to impact the jail population. I removed the additional demographics charts and most of the extraneous text as well:

I then realized that seeing 5 years of data was much better than seeing 3 years of data in terms of allowing the viewer to understand trends. This new view makes it clear that although a precipitous decline is seen, the overall trend in jail population was not significantly impacted until the effects of COVID-19 were seen. This paints a completely different story and calls into questions the effectiveness of the interventions being introduced. With over $2 Million having been invested so far, this calls for serious investigation.

## Test the Solution: User Interviews

## Can you tell me what you think this is?

USER 1: I think this is a visualization that is trying to show me the impacts of certain interventions on the jail population. 
USER 2: I think this is a graph that is showing me what happened after changes were made in the Allegheny County Jail. Specifically, what changes were seen in the jail population after the changes were made. 

## Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

USER 1: This is telling me that the jail population was not impacted by the interventions but was only impacted by COVID-19. 
USER 2: This seems to tell me that the interventions did not go very well. It seems like only COVID-19 had an impact on the jail population. It seems that claiming success would be disingenuous.

## Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

USER 1: I am surprised that COVID-19 had such a drastic effect on the jail population. There may have been some impacts of the interventions as well to see such a drastic impact. 
USER 2: I was surprised that the interventions were so ineffective. It makes me think that maybe it takes time to see those changes lead to actual changes in the jail population, but the grant you mentioned was to do 20% over two years so it seems in this case they failed. 

## Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

USER 1: I think the intended audience is activists and community members that will use this information to judge if the county is truly serious about these interventions. 
USER 2: I think the audience is the funders who are due a report and the committee of folks that have been tasked with getting the population down by 20%. They can now see clearly that the interventions did not go far enough. 

## Is there anything you would change or do differently?

USER 1: No, I can't think of anything. 
USER 2: Yes, I would add the start of the unfunded interventions. I was part of the committee and interventions started even earlier than the funded ones. 


# FINAL VISUALIZATION

## DESCRIPTION

This visualization, in my opinion, is much more valuable to the audience. From 2016 to 2018, no coordinated interventions nor reforms were publicized by the Allegheny County Jail. In 2017, unfunded interventions were piloted in order for Allegheny County to compete in the Safety + Justice Challenge. In 2019, the $2M in grant funding awared in 2019 was dispersed and funded interventions were made. In March of 2020, the impacts of COVID-19 were first seen in the jail population. If the information was public, I would love to add the introduction of any major, individual interventions to see their effect. Overall, this visualization paints a very different picture. The interventions, both unfunded and funded, did not seem to be enough to achieve the 20% reduction in population as promised. If not for COVID-19, Allegheny County was not on pace to be successful in this challenge. However, if major interventions were being saved for the second half of Year 2, then maybe more progress could be made so this visualization would lead me to ask some direct follow-up questions regarding future plans to maintain this low number.
