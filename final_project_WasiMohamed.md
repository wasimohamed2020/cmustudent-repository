# Final Project

# Introduction and Outline

Project Name: Policing and Public Safety in Pittsburgh: Did the addition of the police substation in Northview Heights impact crime rates?

Project Summary: My project will look at the effect, if any, the addition of a Pittsburgh Bureau of Police substation in Northview Heights had on crime in the neighborhood. This is something that has already been determined to be a success and has been subsequently replicated, so I hope to examine if that was justified by the data. 

Project Structure: 

Tool: I plan on completing this project using Shorthand.
