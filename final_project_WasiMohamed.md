# Final Project

# Introduction and Outline

## Project Name: 
Policing and Public Safety in Pittsburgh: Did the addition of the police substation in Northview Heights impact crime rates?

## Project Summary: 
My project will look at the effect, if any, the addition of a Pittsburgh Bureau of Police substation in Northview Heights had on crime in the neighborhood. This is something that has already been determined to be a success and has been subsequently replicated, so I hope to examine if that was justified by the data. 

## Project Structure: 

Storyboard:
1. Explain why the intervention seemed necessary. The police substation was considered as a response to a community survey that stated public safety as a significant concern for the residents of the northside. I would include a visual representation of those survey results that highlights the community concern around public safety. I plan to include some images of Northview Heighs in this section. This will take 8 seconds with 2 seconds of think time.

2. Explain how the Buhl Foundation and subsequently the city chose to invest in the implementation of the substation in Northview Heights based upon those results. I plan to include some images of the 'ribbon-cutting' of the substation and the mayor with the police chief. 

3. Examine impact of substation after one year. Crime data from the City of Pittsburgh is publicly available (see link below). I will include a data visualization looking at the effect the addition of the substation in December 2018 had on crime in Northview Heights. The visualization will include data from 2014 to 2019 and look at Part 1 crimes (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft, vehicle theft and arson.

4. What does data-driven mean? The original survey led to the Northview Heights substation being created and the year-one results led to an investment in two more substations. I want to end this presentation by discussing whether the decisions were justified based upon the data upon which they were made. I hope to then make a broader point on the inclusion of a graph or chart does not make a decision data-driven.

5. Call to action. In this case, decisions were made while referencing data that did not support those decisions and there was not enough of a pushback from community. The call to action, for this paricular issue, is to understand that for too long more policing has been equated with public safety despite that not being the case. Overpolicing black communities, like Northview Heights, is likely why the dispariites exist in the Allegheny County Jail Population. We must reconsider the value of the substation and we must also reconsider our dogmatic belief in policing as a solution to public safety. 

Tool: I plan on completing this project using Shorthand. 

# User Research and Interviews

## Research Protocol
Target Audience: 
The target audience would be policy professionals who are part of the crucial conversation around reimagining public safety. Ideally, those prepare to advocate once convinced of an idea or convinced to question current premises under which policy is being made. 

Scipt/Questions:
1. Give the Project Summary (as shown above).
2. Give an overview of the storyboard. 
3. Was it clear why the substation was added in Northview Heights? Was the visualization of the surveys clear? If not, how could it be improved? 
4. Was the visualization of the impact of the substation on crime clear? If not, how could it be improved? 
5. Did this make you rethink the connection between public safety and policing? 
6. What could be added that would help you to better understand this story? 

Interviewees: 
1. Jennifer Sloan, Social Change Fellow at The Pittsburgh Foundation
2. Dr. Michael Yonas, Director of Research & Special Initiatives
3. Brandi Fisher, Executive Director of the Alliance for Police Accountability 

Answers:
JS: Generally, she hoped it would be longer. 'It is a difficult topic to discuss in a short period of time' was a comment that would describe much of the interview. She appreciated the storyboard and liked how it started from before the substation existed. She found the original visulization clear, but not convincing (which is one of the points I am trying to make so that is good). The crime data visualization was clear but she was interested in disaggregated data (I think a breakdown between different crimes would be interesting, but it may make this too long). She mentioned adding a visualization at the end to show the disparities in Allegheny County Jail which I think is a great idea. She mentioned bringing up mass incarceration explicitly as well. 

MY: Dr. Yonas appreciated the storyboard. He also did not see how this data justifies the decision made, which reinforces my point. He asked about including partial data from the other substations, but I think that it has not been long enough and COVID-19 may impact the results in ways we will not fully understand until later. He said the visualizations were simple and clear. This definintely made him question how these decisions could be called 'data-driven' and wondered if there were things they did not share with the public before making this decision. He also suggested adding a simple visualization at the end regarding Allegheny County Jail would help make my point at the end. 

BF: Brandi immediately resonated with the point that was trying to be made considering the purpose of her organization (so definitely biased). She was deeply upset by how the initial data led to the decision to add the substation and did not understand how they made that jump. She also brought up a really great point regarding the first visualization; she said that many of the respondents felt obligated to answer in ways they think the funders wanted or risk losing support. She also mentioned adding a visualization with the crime stats that showed the results of the community survey performed at the end of year one (I think I might add this). She also mentioned those results are also impacted by the funders conducting the survey. Brandi also mentioned that an Allegheny County Jail visualization would be helpful at the end and she said that the storyboard was well conceived. She understood how this would make one question the premise that 'more policing is good for public safety.'

# Data
Crime in the City of Pittsburgh categorized for Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) from 2010 through May 2020 is publicly available in the Allegheny County data warehouse. This data is collected by the Pittsburgh Burea of Police and the data is updated monthly.
